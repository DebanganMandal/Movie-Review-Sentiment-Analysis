# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Anal
This repository is having the code for the Sentiment analysis of the movie reviews, So its either good or bad. Now we all know the fact that Naive Bayes is a great supervised learning algorithm to predict the reviews, whether they are good or bad. But in this code I have made the use of Deep Learning Neural Network, Convultional Neural Network. I have used the basic NLP extraction, text cleaning, tokenizing, and also other few small things which are helpful for any NLP related projects. Other than that I have made the use of CNN and Word Embedding Algorithm Word2Vec. We all know CNN requires an input layer. So its either a sparse embedding matrix with many zeros, or we can use word2vec algorithm to make a dense matrix and put it to great use using CNN.
I have used the libraries numpy and other required basic python libraries which you can see in the code. Also for Word2Vec I have used Gensim. To apply CNN i have used tensorflow.keras and various sub modules of the library like preprocessing, convolution and many others.

The size of the file was too big so couldn't upload it.
I hope you would love the coding. 
## KEEP CODING
